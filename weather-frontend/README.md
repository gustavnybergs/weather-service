# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Vad jag har lärt mig - Steven ##

I've achieved a deeper understanding on how web services function and how crucial they are in enabling applications to communicate
and exchange data across the internet. While I knew beforehand that there were different types of databases, this program has
taught me that each have a different purpose and function, and can serve better or worse depending situation and context.

I have now further understanding of HTTPS, having previously only known of it during our Frontend course. Understanding how DDoS protection functions
has also been a new eye-opener, having always known what a DDoS attack was but didn't know how to prevent it.

In regards to version control, nothing new has surprised me or come to mind, however I continue to hone my skills by making sure to properly document commits 
in a short-and-sweet format, as well as constantly using branches and keeping out of main, only merging into it.

Our co-operation as a team has been great, as everyone was given a task to do via our Gant schedule and Kanban board. Each of us set out to get it done, without fuss. We aided each other when requested,
to the best of our ability and we can proudly deliver this program.

## Vad jag har lärt mig - Parmida ##
Jag har mer förstått samarbetet och kommunikationen vid webbtjänster och vad som behövs först en webbtjänst ska fungera. 
Jag har nu fattat hela versionshantering och inser varför de är så bra att ha det. 
Samarbetet gick bra, hade bra kommunikation!
